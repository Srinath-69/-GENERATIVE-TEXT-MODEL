      ", the economy is going through an excellent financial year. The number of employees working in tech has increased from 6.5 lakh in 2011 to 11.1 lakh today. It is now 9.8 lakh (with a new number for the last year).\n",
      ". India is a top destination for jobs. There are some countries that have great tech talent in our country. China is in first place, but it is still in fourth place (behind only the US and Japan). The UK is at number one. Australia is number two. That means that Indian tech is expected to grow by around 300,000 jobs annually, and that number is growing faster than the number in Australia. As we continue to move away from the Indian model of technology, it will become even more important to look at how to bring more jobs back to India and bring jobs to our shores. This would involve investing in smart cities and other innovations in areas such as infrastructure and green infrastructure. These are the\n"
